# Mahanoro Station Project

 ## The structure of my project
   - I created a reducers folder which contains the reducer files and the **index.js**. Also, an actions folder for which nhas **index.j** file in it.
   - Also, I created a file which is called **store.js**, then inside of that store I imported the state. 
   - I have a **state.js** file where I added the data.  
   - I created a file that will handle all of the destinations.
   - Then, once I got the data, I made the clickable so that users can choose where they want to go which are in the **ListOfCities.js file**.
   - After that, I added a file which is **City.js**. That file contains the seats to book and the given time.  
   - Finally, a file that contains the information about the bus that users have chosen which is **Booking.js**  

## If I had more time, what area of your project would I improve?  
  - If I had more time, I would work in the **ListOfCities** file to get the right value that it should be .  
  - Did you learn anything new while working on this project?  
      - Yes, I learnt the difference between double equal and triple equal because it took me ages to solve that. 
-   What was the most challenging part for you?
     - The most challenging part for me is to get the four values of the cities from the beginning.
